			<h3>We the Party. Oct, 2022.</h3>
			<p class="comment">
				I attended the wedding of one of my best friends in my home town of Peterborough. My wife and I had the joy of being accompanied by another one of my
				best friends and he came along with his girlfriend. There was a moment after the speeches when the two of them were dancing, almost alone, on the floor.
				Their energy was infectious and I wanted to capture the fun they were having, as well as play around with some cheeky colour manipulations in post.
				<br/><br/>
				Camera details: Captured on my Nikon D3100 at 400 ISO, f/5.6, 1/80 shutter speed and at a 52mm focal length. Edits done in Lightroom Classic.

			<h3>3 views of a Hipo on Carlton Street. Sep, 2022.</h3>
			<p class="comment">This series of photos are the first fruits of my experimentation with B&W photography.
				I wanted to show the motion of differently coloured light through my arrangement of the photos,
				along with how the two people captured in the scene moved through it.
				The location is Carlton street in Hockley, Nottingham.
				<br/><br/>
				Camera details: Captured on my Nikon D3100 at 200 ISO, f/11, 1/40 shutter speed and at a 50mm focal length.
